What is IRS (Image Resize System)
=================================

IRS is a small peace of code written in PHP and designed to resize
images (also referred as creating thumbnails).

What images types are supported
===============================

As of now IRS support GIF, JPG, PNG and BMP.

How does IRS work
=================

IRS reads all original images from the source directory and
writes the resized images in the target directoy.

IRS checks if the source images already exist in the target
directory and if the height and width matches the expected values.

If not IRS overwrites the existing images in the target directory.
Otherwise it skips those files.

Height and width of the target images can be configured as well 
as preserving of the aspect ratio.

If source images are deleted from the source directory IRS will 
delete the target images from the target directory the next time
it is executed.

How IRS can be configured
=========================

Directly in irs.php source and target directory can be configured.

Width and height of the target images can be hardcoded in irs.php
too, but can also be manually set via the user interface. If only
height or width are hardcoded irs.php will automatically set the
corresponding value according to the aspect ratio of the image, as
long as preserving of the aspect ratio is set to true. This also 
applies if the values are set manually in the user interface.

If height and width are hardcoded in irs.php the values can´t be
set in the user interface.

A prefix can be configured for the target images. By default it is
set as 'tmb'.

By default height and width are expected to be in a range between
1 and 5000 pixel (min/max). This can be configured in irs.php too.

Last but not least a screen output of the resize transactions can
be enabled or disabled. By default it is set to 'false'.
